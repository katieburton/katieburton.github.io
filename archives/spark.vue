        <h3 class="flex-1 heading">Immigration is hard.</h3>
        <p class="flex-1">
          Around 300 000 people uproot and immigrate to Canada each year, with
          the top three origins of foreign-born people being from India, China,
          and the Philippines.
          <br /><br />
          Immigrants experience multiple layers of stress, also known as
          acculturation stress, which can significantly impact their mental and
          emotional well-being. This can result in a loss of cultural norms,
          social status, religious customs, social support systems, adjusting to
          a new culture and experiencing changes in identity.

            <strong>1. Life Map</strong>
            <br />
            Participants first mapped out their cultural journey on a timeline,
            adding significant life events, how they’ve connected or
            disconnected to their ethnic culture, and emotions.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Why</strong>
            <br />
            It was a highly reflective activity that gave context to their goals
            and motivations over time while also getting them in the mindset for
            co-creating.

            present.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Why</strong>
            <br />
            It was to help me better understand what goes on in their day-to-day
            and how their culture affects them.

            <strong>3. Questionnaire</strong>
            <br />
            Next, they were to answer 3 questions to find out how they wanted to
            connect with their ethnic culture.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Why</strong>
            <br />
            This really clarified many assumptions I had surrounding the
            solution.

            <strong>4. Crazy 8’s</strong>
            <br />
            Lastly, using the challenge statement participants were to think
            about all the activities they had just completed and try to come up
            with as many solutions to the challenge as possible.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Why</strong>
            <br />
            This activity helped generate more ideas from the target audience
            themselves, to help mitigate my personal biases towards solutions.

          During the interviews, participants were asked to collaboratively tell
          a story of a favourite shared memory. This was for the purpose of
          observing how Asian-Canadian family members interact with each other
