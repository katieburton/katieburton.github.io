          Hackville is Sheridan College's student-organized hackathon, that
          presents challenging problems to incite innovative solutions,
          insightful workshops, inspiring speakers, direct networking, and
          mentorship. The competition was open to 100 post-secondary students
          who love a challenge and who were looking to gain relevant experience.

          This was my first time leading a team of 3 other designers, all coming
          in with various skill levels. As the Hackademics team continued to
          scale up, I wanted to produce something with lasting change for the
          organization to increase efficiency and help maintain consistency
          across platforms. To uphold Hackville's brand values and visual
          direction, I created a brand and illustration guide for my team to
          follow for this and future events.

      <p>
        When studying other hackathons, I found the quality of their branding to
        vary significantly due to most organizers being students (many without
        design backgrounds); many looking outdated. Well-established
        institutions with long-standing hackathons typically had the highest
        quality branding. Most opted for the flat or isometric illustration,
        coloured with tech blues, purples, reds, and whites.

        I was inspired by geometric, flat style for its clean lines,
        replicability, and easily reusable within a component library. I liked
        the idea of creating a theme around complex systems and machinery for
        the designs as the challenge theme for the event was smart cities.

        The previous lead had created the wordmark and lettermark here; however,
        in the brand guide, I added spacing guides for each and rules on
        applying the marks to various assets. The guide gave newer design team
        members and team members from the other teams something to refer to
        ensure the marks were used correctly.

            I added three fundamental illustrative elements for my team to
            follow within the guide: the shapes, highlights and outlines, and
            the grid. To maintain the geometric style and elicit a blueprint
            essence, designers created on top of a grid using seven basic shapes
            to build out the illustrations. Designers could add highlights or
            outlines using a single stroke to add detail to the shapes.

        This project taught me about leadership, managing a team, and setting
        them up for success. I felt it was vital that I aligned all members on
        the vision in a way that was communicated clearly and comprehensibly to
        give the tasks a greater sense of purpose.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-8">
        If I were to do a project like this again, I think creating
        brainstorming workshops for the team to inspire collaboration and give
        everyone a chance to get to know each other better.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-8">
        I wish I had focused more on the target audience and their needs and
        goals at the beginning of the project to help me create a stronger story
        within the creative direction and visual design. At the time, the
        direction was just a cool idea, but it lacked substance and cohesion.
        Spending less time obsessing over perfecting the guides and allowing
        myself and the team to get creating faster would've been a better
        decision in this case.
